# Vercel KV Database Setup for TAC-HUB Forum

## 🗄️ **Database Solution Overview**

The TAC-HUB forum now uses **Vercel KV** (Redis database) for persistent storage that works perfectly on Vercel's serverless platform. This ensures:

- ✅ **Permanent Storage**: Posts persist across deployments and cold starts
- ✅ **Multi-User Visibility**: All users can see each other's posts in real-time
- ✅ **Cross-Platform Sync**: Works across different browsers and devices
- ✅ **Admin Control**: Posts remain until admin decides to delete them
- ✅ **Zero Maintenance**: Fully managed database service

## 🚀 **Setup Instructions**

### Step 1: Create Vercel KV Database

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Navigate to Storage**: Click on "Storage" in the sidebar
3. **Create Database**: Click "Create Database" → Select "KV"
4. **Name Your Database**: e.g., "tac-hub-forum-db"
5. **Select Region**: Choose closest to your users (e.g., US East for global)
6. **Create**: Click "Create" button

### Step 2: Get Database Credentials

After creating the database:

1. **Go to Database Settings**: Click on your newly created KV database
2. **Copy Environment Variables**: You'll see something like:
   ```
   KV_REST_API_URL=https://your-database-url.upstash.io
   KV_REST_API_TOKEN=your-token-here
   ```
3. **Save These Values**: You'll need them for the next step

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

#### For Local Development:
1. **Create `.env.local`** file in your project root:
   ```bash
   KV_REST_API_URL=https://your-database-url.upstash.io
   KV_REST_API_TOKEN=your-token-here
   ```

#### For Vercel Production:
1. **Go to Project Settings**: In Vercel dashboard → Your Project → Settings
2. **Navigate to Environment Variables**: Click "Environment Variables"
3. **Add Variables**:
   - Name: `KV_REST_API_URL`, Value: `https://your-database-url.upstash.io`
   - Name: `KV_REST_API_TOKEN`, Value: `your-token-here`
4. **Apply to All Environments**: Production, Preview, Development

### Step 4: Deploy

1. **Push to Git**: Commit and push your changes
2. **Auto-Deploy**: Vercel will automatically deploy with the new database
3. **Test**: Visit your deployed forum and test posting

## 🔧 **API Endpoints**

The forum now uses these database-powered endpoints:

- **GET `/api/forum-kv`**: Fetch all posts from database
- **POST `/api/forum-kv`**: Create new post in database
- **PUT `/api/forum-kv`**: Update post (likes, replies) in database
- **DELETE `/api/forum-kv`**: Delete post from database (admin only)

## 📊 **Database Structure**

Posts are stored in Vercel KV with this structure:

```json
{
  "id": 123,
  "content": "Post content",
  "author": "User Name",
  "authorRole": "Community Member",
  "authorAvatar": "https://avatar-url.com",
  "category": "general",
  "privacy": "public",
  "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "updatedAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "likes": 5,
  "likedBy": ["user1@email.com", "user2@email.com"],
  "replies": [
    {
      "id": 456,
      "content": "Reply content",
      "author": "Another User",
      "authorRole": "Community Member",
      "authorAvatar": "https://avatar-url.com",
      "createdAt": "2024-01-15T11:00:00Z",
      "likes": 2,
      "likedBy": ["user3@email.com"]
    }
  ],
  "tags": ["Climate", "Conservation"]
}
```

## 🔍 **Testing the Forum**

After setup, test these scenarios:

1. **User A posts**: Create a post → Should appear immediately
2. **User B visits**: Open forum in different browser → Should see User A's post
3. **User B likes**: Click like button → Count should increase
4. **User B replies**: Add a reply → Should appear in thread
5. **Refresh page**: All data should persist
6. **Wait 10 minutes**: Visit again → All posts should still be there
